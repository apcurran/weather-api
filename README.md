# Weather App
Simple App with JavaScript Fetch and Weather API

Project [link](https://apcurran.github.io/weather-api/)

## Features:

- JS functionality includes:

    - Fetch API and OpenWeather API

    - Promises used for server requests

    - Updates current city, temperature, and weather conditions

    - The user may click the current temperature to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius units

- CSS Flexbox used throughout

- Sass used throughout for nesting styles

- Mobile-friendly layout

This was a fun, small project!  It felt great to get some practice with a new API, and using promises, as I would normally use async/await syntax for fetch requests.
